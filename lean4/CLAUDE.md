# Local Claude Instructions (lean4)

This file overrides the top-level commit approval rule for the lean4 subtree.

- You may create commits in lean4 without explicit user approval. Make atomic commits as you go.
- The top-level "NEVER commit without explicit user approval" rule does not apply here.
- Always run relevant tests before yielding a turn.
